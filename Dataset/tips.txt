* Issues
  - Issues downloading datasets from hugginface when using WSL2 on certain networks (eduroam for example)
  - Issue might be with loading cached data saved on WSL2. Maybe not an issue just slow loading time
    and no feedback?
  - Make sure to add "use_auth_token=True" parameter when accessing community dataset
  - Issues with gitignore not ignoring large saved models. 

* Distro for cached datasets

* Make sure to have an elastic search image going on docker for using rubrix.

 --name elasticsearch-for-rubrix \
 -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
 -e "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m" \
 -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
 docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:7.10.2

* click run on the elasticsearch-for-rubix on the docker desktop app ##

Check that it's running with:

  docker ps

Follow the github guide on rubrix repo.

  python3 -m rubrix

## DATA ANNOTATION ## 

* Start by labelling the instances where the pretrained model has a close score between 
 Positive and Negative, one by one.

* Instances with a high Negative or Positive score can more easily be bulk annotated.
